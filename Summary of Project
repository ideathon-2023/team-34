WEBSITE NAME: flamingo
The main idea of "flamingo" is to make a platform where people of any age group can answer a series of questions to find out their skin type and hair type and find the best suitable body products. 
Before using any type of products, one needs to have knowlegde about their bodies so that products used favour your body type. So, determining the skin type and hair type is important.
Along with determining your type on the basis of a test specially designed by renowned dermatologists and trichologists, our website also enlightens the person with information on different types of skins
and hair present around the globe and which one is your and how should care about it (i.e. naturally or chemically). 
Test is of short duration i.e. less than or equal to 15 minutes and asks simple and relatable questions from a person as to what do they experience in their day to day life. After the answers are processed, 
the person is shown a detailed report of the body type and recommended products.
It should be noted that we dont sell products. After the test is completed, our job is to bring the top five best quality products favouring that particular type present around the web in a listed form in 
front of the person so that it saves the person the effort to surf around the web. In this manner, the less recognised websites specialising in health care which have good products in real sense also get their
business enhanced.
In simple words, our website will perform two tasks :
1) Revealing the skin type and hair type.
2) Recommending the products for his/her type. (optional)
